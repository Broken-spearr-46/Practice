## Overview 
In this project I want make a Tracker for me to use for every day so I can track my expenses

## Day 1 Creating the Expense Tracker (Basic Features)
- Built a console-based expense tracker in Python.
- Added a while loop to continuously run the program until the user chooses to exit.
- Used if, elif, and else statements to handle user choices.
- Implemented four main features:
  - [x] Add Expenses – Allows users to input expenses.
  - [x] View Expenses – Displays the recorded expenses.
  - [x] Calculate Total Expenses – Computes and shows the total amount spent.
  - [x] Save & Exit – Ends the program.

## Day 2: Storing User Input in a JSON File
- Modified the program to store expenses in a JSON file instead of keeping them in memory.
- Used the json module to:
  - [X] Save expenses to a file (write to JSON).
  - [X] Load existing expenses when the program starts (read from JSON).
